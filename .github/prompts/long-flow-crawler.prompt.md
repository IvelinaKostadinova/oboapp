**This prompt activates the Long-Flow Crawler Generator skill** (`.github/skills/long-flow-crawler-generator.skill.md`).

Plan the implementation of a new crawler (/ingest/crawlers). It should work similar to sofia-bg, rayon-oborishte-bg and mladost-bg since it does not provide ready GeoJSON. This means that its output will go through the long ingestion flow. The addition of a source requires changes in both /ingest (for adding the crawler and documentation) and /web (for adding the source logo and metadata).
